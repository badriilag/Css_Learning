    <p class="box_model"> <strong> What makes a good small business idea?</strong>
    When I tried turning my love of salsa dancing into a business, I rented a small space, promoted my classes, and poured everything into making it work.
    
    At first, it was exciting. I had a skill people wanted to learn, and I was passionate about teaching.
    
    But pretty soon, I ran into problems. The overhead costs ate into my profits, getting students to commit was harder than I expected, and I found myself spending more time trying to fill classes than actually teaching.
    
    Eventually, I realized the business model wasn’t sustainable, and I pivoted to freelancing instead.
    
    Looking back, I can see exactly why my salsa business struggled. And I’ve learned that the best small business ideas share a few key traits. If an idea checks these boxes, it has a much better shot at success.
