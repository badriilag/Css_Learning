        <strong>Focus on transition words</strong>
Teach students to use transition words to link ideas and make their writing flow:<br>

Introduction: “To begin with,” “In this paragraph, I will explain…”<BR>

Details: “For example,” “Also,” “In addition,” “Another reason is…”<br>

<strong>Conclusion:</strong> “In summary,” “As you can see,” “To conclude…”

Model and write together
Think aloud: Model writing a paragraph on a board or paper while explaining your thought process.<br>
Shared writing: Write a paragraph collaboratively, brainstorming and deciding on the content together.<br>

Use sentence sorting activities
Write a scrambled paragraph on sentence strips. Have students work together to arrange the sentences into a logical order with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
 </p>
   <h2 class="heading2"><b>Break it down</b>
    Focus on one part of the paragraph at a time:<br>
    
    Day 1: Write topic sentences for different prompts.<br>
    
    Day 2: Add 2-3 supporting details to each topic sentence.<br>
    
    Day 3: Practice writing conclusions.</h2>
